# Storygraph Export to Goodreads format

Trying to decide which reading tracking app to use? Are you frustrated not being able to swap exports between apps easily? Me too. That's why I created this application to convert the Storygraph exports into the Goodreads format so it can be imported into other apps (Goodreads, Fable, etc.)

## How to use


## What it does

This program takes the Storygraph CSV export and converts it into the Goodreads format. Because of the difference in format, ***some*** data wil be lost. This includes the number of re-reads and the contributors.

The Storygraph fields such as "Character or plot-driven" will be condensed into a new review field. A typical review from Storygraph will be converted to this format for a Goodreads review:


<b>Moods:</b> funny, lighthearted <br>
<b>Pace:</b> fast <br>
<b>Character or plot driven?</b> Character <br>
<b>Strong character development?</b> Yes <br>
<b>Loveable Characters?</b> Yes <br>
<b>Diverse Characters?</b> Yes <br>
<b>Are character flaws a main focus?</b> Yes <br>

<i><b>Moderate:</b></i> Death <br>
<i><b>Minor:</b></i> Infidelity <br>
